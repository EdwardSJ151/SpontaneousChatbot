# Spontaneous Chatbot
A chatbot that interacts with the user without direct input. It acts on its own volition by reading the messages being sent and deciding if it wants to interact futher with the user. Other variables affect its thought process, such as the bots current mood, what its thinking and what its curious about.

With LMQL, we can "program" LLMs so we can constrain and direct the LLMs output as much as possible, much more than normal prompting or chain of thought prompting.

With LMQL, we can easily implement logic, escaping, stop phrases, etc...

Done:
- Basic prompts for the chat to function.
- Considered usage of other packages such as Guidance and Outlines.

Doing: 
- Thinking of chat structure to guarentee the chatbots spontaneous behavior.
- Refining prompts.
- Testing multiple local models to use seperate models for inference with each prompt.
- Implementing memory system for the chatbot.

To-Do:
- Implement chat structure.
- Consider implementing RAG.
- OpenAI support for those interested.
- Create visual interface for chatbot (Streamlit)

In development...
